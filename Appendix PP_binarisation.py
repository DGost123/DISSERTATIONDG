# The 0.5 threshold suggestion is for sigmoid function, because it is symmetric around 0 and hits 0.5 at 0
# should also tune your threshold. Several statistics such as ROC curve, Precision/Recall curves are obtained the measure 
# the performance while changing this threshold, and they're used to understand the behavior of the system.
#  more commonly suggested option for sigmoid, for instance, is to use your class priors.

# https://machinelearningmastery.com/threshold-moving-for-imbalanced-classification/

# many machine learning algorithms are capable of predicting a probability or scoring of class membership, and this must be
#interpreted before it can be mapped to a crisp class label. This is achieved by using a threshold, such as 0.5, where 
#all values equal or greater than the threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to another class.
#For those classification problems that have a severe class imbalance, the default threshold can result in poor performance.
#As such, a simple and straightforward approach to improving the performance of a classifier that predicts probabilities 
# on an imbalanced classification problem is to tune the threshold used to map probabilities to class labels.

# Label cardinality signifies the average number of labels present in the training data set. Label cardinality is 
#independent of the number of labels present in the dataset. Label density takes into consideration the number of labels
#present in the dataset.

#Thresholding strategy:
#Calibrate a threshold such that LCard(Y) ≈ LCard(Yˆ )
#I e.g., training data has label cardinality of 1.7;
#I set a threshold t such that the label cardinality of the test data is as
#close as possible to 1.7

pipeline = make_pipeline( model)
predictions = model.predict(X.values)
print(predictions)


# In[227]:


#I prefer to leave the threshold at 0.5 for one simple reason: In classification you are trying to train a model which can 
#clearly separate between the classes/labels, i.e. for binary case predict 0 and 1 as good as possible.
#So if your model is equally good in predicting 0’s as it is in predicting 1’s you will have many predicted probabilities
#close to 0 and many close to 1 and thus a broad margin between the two classes in the middle. So a threshold of 0.5 will
#nicely work in this case.
#However, if the model is not good in predicting one or both classes the probabilities will be spread out more between 0.0 
#and 1.0. Then you could try to play with the threshold or you can try to improve you model to be able to better separate 
#etween both classes. Same applies for Multi-label classification as it is also using binary cross-entropy and each label
#is predicted with a probability between 0 and 1.

# This means that there is no F-score to calculate for this label, and thus the F-score for this case is considered
# to be 0.0. Since you requested an average of the score, you must take into account that a score of 0 was included in the
# calculation, and this is why scikit-learn is showing you that warning
# When true positive + false positive == 0, precision is undefined; When true positive + false negative == 0, 
# recall is undefined. In such cases, by default the metric will be set to 0, as will f-score, and UndefinedMetricWarning 
# will be raised. This behavior can be modified with zero_division

# This error occurs under two circumstances:
#If you have used train_test_split() to split your data, you have to make sure that you reset the index of the data
#(specially when taken using a pandas series object): y_train, y_test indices should be resetted. 
#The problem is when you try to use one of the scores from sklearn.metrics such as; precision_score,
#this will try to match the shuffled indices of the y_test that you got from train_test_split().
#so use, either np.array(y_test) for y_true in scores or y_test.reset_index(drop=True)

#Then again you can still have this error if your predicted 'True Positives' is 0, which is used for precision,
#recall and f1_scores. You can visualize this using a confusion_matrix. If the classification is multilabel and you set

# 'weighted': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average weighted by support (the number of true instances for

#ROC curves typically feature true positive rate on the Y axis, and false positive rate on the X axis. This means that 
#the top left corner of the plot is the “ideal” point - a false positive rate of zero, and a true positive rate of one. 
#This is not very realistic, but it does mean that a larger area under the curve (AUC) is usually better.
#The “steepness” of ROC curves is also important, since it is ideal to maximize the true positive rate while minimizing the false positive rate.
#ROC curves are typically used in binary classification to study the output of a classifier. In order to extend ROC curve and ROC area to multi-class or multi-label classification, it is necessary to binarize the output. One ROC curve can be drawn per label, but one can also draw a ROC curve by considering each element of the label indicator matrix as a binary prediction (micro-averaging).

# The output value is the prediction for that observation (the prediction of the first row in Table B is 6.20).
# The base value: The original paper explains that the base value E(y_hat) is “the value that would be predicted if we
# did not know any features for the current output.” In other words, it is the mean prediction, or mean(yhat). 
# You may wonder why it is 5.62. This is because the mean prediction of Y_test is 5.62. 
# You can test it out by Y_test.mean() which produces 5.62.
# Red/blue: Features that push the prediction higher (to the right) are shown in red, and those pushing the prediction lower are in blue.
